# 🥧 PIE (PHP Installer for Extensions)

## What is PIE?

PIE is a new installer for PHP extensions, intended to eventually replace PECL.
It is distributed as a [PHAR](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.phar.php),
just like Composer, and works in a similar way to Composer, but it installs PHP
extensions (PHP Modules or Zend Extensions) to your PHP installation, rather
than pulling PHP packages into your project or library.

## What do I need to get started?

You will need PHP 8.1 or newer to run PIE, but PIE can install an extension to
any installed PHP version.

On Linux, you will need a build toolchain installed. On Debian/Ubuntu type
systems, you could run something like:

```shell
sudo apt install gcc make autoconf libtool bison re2c pkg-config php-dev
```

On Windows, you do not need any build toolchain installed, since PHP extensions
for Windows are distributed as pre-compiled packages containing the extension
DLL.

## I'm an extension maintainer

If you are an extension maintainer wanting to add PIE support to your extension,
please read [extension-maintainers](./docs/extension-maintainers.md).

## Installing PIE

### Manual installation

- Download `pie.phar` either:
  - [latest stable release](https://github.com/php/pie/releases)
  - [latest unstable nightly](https://php.github.io/pie/pie-nightly.phar)
- Verify the PHAR's source with `gh attestation verify --owner php pie.phar`
- You may then invoke PIE with `php pie.phar <command>`

Further installation details can be found in the [usage](./docs/usage.md) docs.
This documentation assumes you have moved `pie.phar` into your `$PATH`, e.g.
`/usr/local/bin/pie` on non-Windows systems.

## Extensions that support PIE

A list of extensions that support PIE can be found on
[https://packagist.org/extensions](https://packagist.org/extensions).

## Installing an extension using PIE

You can install an extension using the `install` command. For example, to
install the `example_pie_extension` extension, you would run:

```shell
$ pie install example/example-pie-extension
This command may need elevated privileges, and may prompt you for your password.
You are running PHP 8.3.10
Target PHP installation: 8.3.10 nts, on Linux/OSX/etc x86_64 (from /usr/bin/php8.3)
Found package: example/example-pie-extension:1.0.1 which provides ext-example_pie_extension
phpize complete.
Configure complete.
Build complete: /tmp/pie_downloader_66e0b1de73cdb6.04069773/example-example-pie-extension-769f906/modules/example_pie_extension.so
Install complete: /usr/lib/php/20230831/example_pie_extension.so
You must now add "extension=example_pie_extension" to your php.ini
$
```

## Installing all extensions for a project

When in your PHP project, you can install any missing top-level extensions:

```
$ pie install
🥧 PHP Installer for Extensions (PIE), 0.9.0, from The PHP Foundation
You are running PHP 8.3.19
Target PHP installation: 8.3.19 nts, on Linux/OSX/etc x86_64 (from /usr/bin/php8.3)
Checking extensions for your project your-vendor/your-project
requires: curl ✅ Already installed
requires: intl ✅ Already installed
requires: json ✅ Already installed
requires: example_pie_extension ⚠️  Missing

The following packages may be suitable, which would you like to install:
  [0] None
  [1] asgrim/example-pie-extension: Example PIE extension
 > 1
   > 🥧 PHP Installer for Extensions (PIE), 0.9.0, from The PHP Foundation
